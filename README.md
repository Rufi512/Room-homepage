# Frontend Mentor - Room homepage solution - Rufi512

Hi everyone :wave: this is my first challenge that I do on this platform and I thought it would be fun to start with something in between (and it was) And well, in this challenge I wanted to try using only html, css and javascript nothing else but thinking about it a bit I decided to also use webpack to facilitate the import of resources in cases I get to use it and also to put together a small work area to continue making small web pages :stuck_out_tongue:
